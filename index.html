  I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned<br> were current, if not more so,

    <p id="emt">
  ‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.The next 12<br> weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù

   <p id="experience">
  Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!
  </p>
  <p id="bootcamp">
  ‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
  did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
  project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
  could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
  experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
  100% recommend! ‚Äù

  Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp<br>themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from<br>their experiences was easy.

  ‚Äú The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing.The<br>program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present<br>myself as a capable junior developer.
